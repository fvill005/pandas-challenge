In analyzing the data from Heros of Pymoli, there are a few trends that we can observe. Firstly, from the overall player count, we can see that an overwhelming percentage of the players are male. This generally follows the societal norm that gamers are mostly male. The creators of Heros of Pymoli could use this information to perhaps change their marketing to try and draw in more non-male players in order to expand their player count and overall player base. We can also observe that regardless of gender the players average total purchase(s) are relatively close to each other. Thus spending is not necessarily dependent on gender, however if the creators can expand their player base by drawing more non-male players this can result in higher purchase count of extra game items. Another trend we can observe is the age of the players.In Heros of Pymoli, most of the players are between 20 and 24 years old and from that age range, they spend the most on in-game purchases. While the rest of the age groups hardly purchase any additional content comparatively. Once again the creators could see this as the target age group to focus on in order to fully maximize the players 20-24 willingness to buy in-game content. }
